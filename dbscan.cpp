/* 
* TimeComplexity

run () iterates over all points: O(N)
for each unclassified point, it calls expandCluster()

expandCluster()
calls calculateCluster()
    for each point, it computes distance to every other point O(N)
then iterates over neighbors and if any core points, 
    recursively find their neighbors.

worst-case: every point is a neighbor to every other point(dense dataset)
so in the worst-case: expandCluster() could do O(N^2) total work(each point checking all others.)

Even though you do nested loops, you're not doing N * N * N work always.
at worst youre doing sth like O(N) expandCluster calls, each of which may do upto O(N) neighbor
checks and each neighbor check is O(N) -- but in practice, you dont reprocess already labeled.
you avoid recomputing for points already added to a cluster.

calculateCluster()
O(N) as it loops over all N points.

Hence
WORST TIME COMPLEXITY:
O(N^2)
